Generating novel protein sequences using Gibbs sampling of masked language models, _S.R. Johnson et-al_

One sentence description:
--------------------------

The autors describe a framework in which they use unsupervised language models such as ProtBert, ESM to sample novel protein sequences using gibbson sampling. They measure the performance of their approach purely computationally.
